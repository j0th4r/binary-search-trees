# 📚 Balanced Binary Search Tree - JavaScript Implementation

## 🧠 About

This project is a complete implementation of a **Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST)** in JavaScript, built as part of a data structures assignment from The Odin Project. The tree supports core operations like insertion, deletion, search, multiple traversals, and balance checking—all while maintaining the BST's efficiency by keeping it balanced.

No duplicate values are allowed in the tree, ensuring clean, predictable behavior and better balance.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Balanced Tree Construction** from an input array (duplicates removed & sorted)
- 🌿 **Node & Tree Classes** using clean, modular design
- ➕ **Insertion** with automatic placement
- ❌ **Deletion** handling all cases (no child, one child, two children)
- 🔍 **Search** for specific nodes
- 🔁 **Traversals**: Level-order, In-order, Pre-order, Post-order (all accept a callback)
- 📏 **Height & Depth** calculation
- ⚖️ **Balance Check** to ensure structural integrity
- 🔄 **Rebalancing** unbalanced trees using traversal-based reconstruction
- 🌳 **Console Tree Visualization** with `prettyPrint`

## 📸 Tree Visualization

I used the provided `prettyPrint()` function to help visualize the structure of the tree directly in the console for easier debugging and understanding.
